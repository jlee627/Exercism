## Lessons Learned

Overall, working in Rust has been very nice. I feel like there's a lot of functions that just make everything soo much easier to work with, especially when it comes to needing to access things like arrays. Concatenation in rust is also amazingly simple, and I really like how easy it is to use and make test cases. It was also actually enjoyable working with vectors, as I haven't really had to work a whole lot with them before but there are so many functions that really blend together with them and make them a lot more manageable.  One thing is for certain though, Exercism.io is brilliant and I loved working with it.

## Experimental Lessons

It's getting a bit easier wrestling with type mismatches, especially in this assignment since there really wasn't anything too crazy. Learning how to use functions like the all/map function was a little confusing since there is a bit of syntax to it, but I really like how a lot of functions are named what you think they would be. Things are simply named like to_string() or format(). Overall I felt like these were nice straightforward puzzles that had clear answers and we got to figure them out in Rust.
